# Animal tracking with GBIF database
http://gbifgetinfo.pythonanywhere.com/

In my project the main goal was to design a simple web page that will process data taken from a random GBIF's dataset and based on the user's commands either display a map (either centralized and eddited recording to the coordinates written by user or map of all reserve territory) or, display data accordingly to the user's choice. The main idea and functionalities are imitations of sensors that check heartbeat, blood pressure ect. Their update takes place accordingly to the categories that depend on problems and special needs of an animal.
